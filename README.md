# CPBeanBot-Bad-
First iteration of BeanBot. Bean Bot uses OpenCV in python to conduct image detection and tracking for a web brouser based game. This was a horribly inefficient and inaccurate version which i hope i can fix later but it will need to be remade from the ground up. private as this is for only personal reference cause its bad and should not be used.
The main issue was spead as i could only get it to run at about 5 frames per second or 5 checks every second. Unfortuantly the objects move far faster than that and this made the tracking rather innacurate. The second itteration i brought it down to all the way to using windows API directly with python. unfortuantly it still was not fast enough to meet my needs. Was a great learning experience for object detection and tracking systems. I do plan on revisiting this later on with a different method that may be more promising.
